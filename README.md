# Netflix-SQL-Analysis-Project
This repository contains a comprehensive set of SQL queries for analyzing Netflix content data. The project demonstrates data exploration, aggregation, string manipulation, window functions, and business-driven SQL problem solving.
Project Overview

Dataset: Netflix content information including shows, movies, directors, cast, release year, country, genre, ratings, duration, and descriptions.

Goal: Solve 15 business questions and perform advanced SQL analysis to generate actionable insights from the Netflix dataset.

SQL Skills Demonstrated:

Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

String manipulation (UNNEST, STRING_TO_ARRAY, SPLIT_PART, ILIKE)

Conditional logic (CASE, WHEN)

Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)

Date handling and filtering (TO_DATE, INTERVAL)

CTEs and query optimization

‚ö° Example SQL Queries
-- Count Movies vs TV Shows
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM Netflix GROUP BY type;

-- Top 5 countries with most content
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country,',')) AS country_array, COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM Netflix
GROUP BY country_array
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Top 10 actors in movies produced in India
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts,',')) AS actors, COUNT(*) AS total_number
FROM Netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY actors
ORDER BY total_number DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Categorize content based on 'kill' or 'violence'
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM (
  SELECT CASE
    WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'BAD'
    ELSE 'GOOD'
  END AS category
  FROM Netflix
) AS t
GROUP BY category;
